# PCB-JY
## Note
This project code is modified based on https://github.com/Ixiaohuihuihui/Tiny-Defect-Detection-for-PCB. I have only made minor changes so that it would be more readable and excutable for students whose computers don't have GPUs and need specific details on how to implement this wonderful project and some common problems that might be encountered during the process. Therefore if you have GPU on your laptop and would like to more about this project you could check the original website.
